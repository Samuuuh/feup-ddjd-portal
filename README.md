# Portal Stories: Through FEUP

"After meeting GLaDOS, a student developed a portal gun to help in a big task: steal the exams from the teacher's office to get better grades. On the other hand, GLaDOS wants more test subjects and has prepared some challenges for the student through the DEI department. With the help of portals, the student will be able to avoid teachers and security cameras placed all over the place. After finding the exams, the student should try to find a way out."

Portal Stories: Through FEUP is a game inspired by the original Portal game. In our version, the game is 2D but the objective is similar: the player must use his portals to reach a final destination, surpassing many obstacles.
